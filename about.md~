 I am a Marine Ecologist, I work for the [Spanish Institute of Oceanography](http://www.ieo.es/es/web/gijon), a governmental research institution. I am a biologist but most of my work deals with data analysis and model development. Although I am involved in experimental studies of the effects of global warming on plankton physiology, most of my latest research is focused on the development of imaging systems and software for the automatic classification of plankton using deep learning techniques. I believe that machine learning can make a difference in the scientific community by automating repetitive tasks so researchers can focus on more impactful work.
